For PA1, I just change the page to respond with JSONP object 
For caching, i just make a dictionary and only store the input if there are more than 10 links because if not
there are more to store 
For PA2, i modified the front to query for PA1 for player result, add code for the page to contact admin asmx 
to ask for crawled and inded sites, then sue LINQ to rank it. I also add the code to put new #titles and last title
to the dashboard.
For PA3, much still stays the same except for the inverted index change part.
